This project is all about accurately driving brushless motors, for cheap. The aim is to make it possible to use inexpensive brushless motors in high performance robotics projects, like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT4E5nb3KtY).

Please refer to the [Developer Guide](https://docs.odriverobotics.com/developer-guide) to get started with ODrive firmware development.
